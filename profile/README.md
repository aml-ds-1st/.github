### **No. 01 : Analysis of time-series effects on Rail Temperature Prediction Model based on Machine Learning Methods.**

This project is to analyze time-series effects on Rail Temperature Prediction Model (RTPM) basd on Machine Learning Mehtods. We mainly used `Random Forest`, `XGboost`, `Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)` and `Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)`. We described detailed results at the repository. We used `pyhon`, especially `tensorflow` and `pytorch`. If you need more detailed information or collaboration, Please contact us! <br>
